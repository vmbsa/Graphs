# Graphs

This project was developed within the Object-Oriented Programming course unit and consisted in creating a program that would organize data from Excel sheets in structures and use this to create graphics. The user had the opportunity to load the sheet he wanted, and could then apply some filters to it, changing the visual aspect of the presented graphic, facilitating its interpretation.
